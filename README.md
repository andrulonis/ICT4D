## Usage

The API exposes one endpoint at the root URL that returns the VXML file. To view it, make a GET request to `http://<host>:<port>/`. This will redirect you to the English version of the service. 

**Other languages**

Navigate to `http://<host>:<port>/<lang>` to retrieve the VXML file in other languages, where `<lang>` is the requested language. Please consult the below table for which value to use in place of `<lang>`:

|Language|`<lang>`|
|--------|--------|
|English (default)|`en`|
|French|`fr`|
